 * Description: Script to rename files with spaces in them to underscores
 */

1. Run the script in (any) directory. 

2. You will be prompted to input a name. This is the name that the script 
   will write all relevant files with spaces to. Make sure this file name
   is one that does not exist already in your current directory so that 
   your original file will not be overwritten. 

3. You will then be prompted to input a name (again). This is the name that
   the script will write all relevant information regarding renaming to. 
   Check this log after the program finishes running to check what files
   were renamed, to what, how many files, etc. Again, make sure this file
   name is one that does not exist in your current directory already so 
   that your original file will not be overwritten.  

*Note: This program will rename ALL files with spaces, so if you do not
want your ./config files to be renamed, make sure you don't run it in the
directory that contains these files.
